       "'2020 I adore this game. it\\'s deceptive simple, yet actually somewhat difficult. there\\'s a variety of time trials to keep the vibe going post-story--took me 10 hours to play through the story. so if you\\'re into speedrunning or anything like that, this will be hella fun 2020 very chiil love the vibesskate fasteat trash 2020 just a great game 2020 A Bird\\'s Eye View Curator 🦜IntroductionTanuki Sunset is a game in which you play as a rebel raccoon not only disobeying their mother by not wearing a helm but also all of the Tony Hawk knowledge I possess that you don\\'t do tricks on a longboard AND the titular Tanuki even does it without looking ahead!Visuals and MechanicsThe visuals of Tanuki Sunset are a gorgeous depiction of the 80\\'s synthwavey style with dancing to the music suns and buildings and overall vibrant and un-photorealistic style of the entire game and it\\'s menus. As for the mechanics boy is this game an example of easy to learn and hard to master. Much further than steering, drifting and a few tricks the game doesn\\'t push you but if you want to do it well you need to be on the ball!GameplayThe absolute first thing I noticed when playing the game is that a bit counter intuitively drifting is NOT good and only slows you down. You should learn when and where you don\\'t need to drift. All of the stages aren\\'t always the same and it\\'s more comparable to a Super Mario World \\'tileset\\' where a stage has road shapes and obstacles to progressively pick from which can be really kind to you or create triple s-curve snakey hell on earth! A few small quirks I\\'d like to mention though are things like the difference between doing a ramp well and not is basically non-existent so at first you have no clue if you do it well or not and that sometimes the tutorial monkey flat out forgets to explain the controls for keyboard and just says \"press Y\". That said I absolutely appreciate the attention to detail of giving you a smooth and continuous experience from the soundtrack I\\'ll go into detail about later and the game not catapulting you off of your board if you don\\'t perfectly do 180 degree increments of a spin or if you hit most obstacles. A lot of the obstacles just slow you down instead of ending your attempt.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is varied between quite a few genres and artists but it overall creates a really cool homogeneous blend of a \\'mini-soundtrack\\' per location. Every location change also changes what songs the shuffle picks from so that every location and stage feels and sounds largely different. To be a bit nitpicky however some songs really don\\'t fade well into each other creating a long trailing fade-out or silence halting the continuous mood. On the side of the sound design it\\'s largely a non-intrusive and charming selection of sounds emphasizing your actions but every now and then the jump squeak does get overly present.ConclusionThen, in conclusion, would I recommend you to get this game? Absolutely! Tanuki Sunset is a very enjoyable experience that will keep you hooked for many hours and the experience heavily outweighs the small \\'new game hiccups\\' like the highlight in menus not following your selection but just remembering the last option picked and that for example the second checkpoint indicated on the progression bar between 3-1 and 3-2 doesn\\'t exist. Tanuki Sunset is ideal for people just wanting a fun and enjoyable game and a great challenge for the completionists among us!Associated Media A bird\\'s-eye view of Tanuki Sunset A Video of Tanuki Sunset By: Yingwu Usagiri Hidden video for Steam review (sorry for the Discord pings, I had no idea game capture would\\'ve captured those too as I was streaming) The drifting trickster not even looking A Screenshot of Tanuki Sunset By: Yingwu Usagiri 2020 great game but it is rather short'"
