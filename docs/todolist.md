Here's an updated MVP implementation plan based on the new architecture represented in the flowchart:

---

### **Revised MVP Implementation Plan for LangChain SQL Query Builder with LLM-Powered Visualizations & Reporting**

#### 1. **Setup the Development Environment**
   - [x] Choose a programming language for the project (Python is recommended).
   - [x] Set up a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).
   - [x] Install core dependencies:
     - LangChain library for query builder (`pip install langchain`).
     - LLM Integration (OpenAI or other API integration).
     - SQLAlchemy for database interaction.
     - Pandas for data manipulation.
     - Matplotlib or Plotly for data visualization.
     - Streamlit or Flask for front-end interaction (optional).
   - [x] Test the environment to ensure everything works.

#### 2. **Enhanced Pre-Processing for Query Understanding**
   - [ ] **Implement Pre-Processing for Natural Language Requests**:
     - [ ] Remove padding words and irrelevant terms from user input to refine and focus the query.
     - [ ] Identify key keywords for SQL query development based on the user's input.
   - [ ] **Standardize Prompt Formatting for LLM Requests**:
     - [ ] Develop a prompt format to structure user input effectively for the LLM request.
   - [ ] Integrate pre-processing steps into a dedicated "Pre-Processing Quest" module that prepares input before SQL generation.

#### 3. **Integrate LangChain SQL Query Builder**
   - [ ] Connect LangChain to a SQL database (can use SQLite or any other dataset with a simple schema).
   - [ ] Create a function to initialize a database connection and query builder.
   - [ ] Create a module to handle dataset import (e.g., CSV) and push it into the SQL database for query building.
   - [ ] Implement basic SQL query generation using LangChain's SQLQueryChain or equivalent:
     - [ ] Use the cleaned and pre-processed user input to guide SQL generation.
     - [ ] Ensure SQL security with input sanitization.

#### 4. **Develop LLM-Powered Query Processing**
   - [ ] Integrate an LLM (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT) for natural language processing.
     - [ ] Set up the API connection to your LLM of choice.
   - [ ] Implement a function to parse user questions and pass them to LangChain to generate corresponding SQL queries.
   - [ ] Handle different types of queries (e.g., aggregations, filtering, time-based queries).
   - [ ] Ensure error handling for invalid or overly complex queries (graceful failure + messaging).

#### 5. **Database Pre-fetching and Management**
   - [ ] Develop a **Database Pre-fetching** mechanism to retrieve metadata or frequently accessed information.
   - [ ] Implement a caching system to store frequently used datasets or queries for optimized performance.
   - [ ] Integrate pre-fetching to anticipate queries based on common data patterns or user preferences.

#### 6. **Data Visualization Integration**
   - [ ] Create a module for generating visualizations based on the returned dataset from SQL queries.
     - Use libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or Altair for generating visuals.
     - Support various chart types: Bar charts, Line graphs, Pie charts, Scatter plots, etc.
   - [ ] **LLM Visualization Formatting**:
     - [ ] Implement logic in the LLM to map the query type to a suitable visualization format (e.g., time-series data should be shown in line charts).
     - [ ] Allow user customization for visualizations (optional) – such as choosing a chart type, adding labels, etc.
     - [ ] Include logic to adjust visualization parameters dynamically based on LLM suggestions.

#### 7. **Report Generation and Formatting**
   - [ ] **Standardized Visualization Formatting (From Query)**:
     - [ ] Ensure consistency in visualization formatting for different query outputs.
   - [ ] Develop a reporting module to summarize query results in both textual and visual formats:
     - [ ] Automatically generate a brief description of the insights derived from the query results (e.g., top-performing products).
   - [ ] Enable exporting reports:
     - [ ] Create functionality to download reports as PDF or HTML files.
     - [ ] Include charts, tables, and automatically generated text insights in the reports.

#### 8. **User Interface (UI) Implementation**
   - [ ] Build a simple UI or CLI for users to input their questions or queries:
     - Option 1: Use CLI (simpler for MVP).
     - Option 2: Build a front-end using Streamlit/Flask for user interaction.
   - [ ] Implement text input for natural language questions.
   - [ ] Show query results and visualizations interactively on the page.

#### 9. **Testing & Debugging**
   - [ ] Test the entire pipeline with various datasets (large and small).
   - [ ] Validate SQL queries generated by the LLM to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
   - [ ] Test the visualizations for different datasets and question types.
   - [ ] Add unit tests for key functionalities (e.g., SQL generation, visualization rendering).
   - [ ] Test pre-processing steps (padding removal, keyword extraction) to ensure clean and accurate inputs.

#### 10. **Enhancements and Optimizations (Optional for MVP)**
   - [ ] Add functionality to handle more complex SQL queries (joins, subqueries, etc.).
   - [ ] Implement caching of frequent queries for faster responses.
   - [ ] Optimize performance for large datasets (e.g., pagination or lazy loading of results).

#### 11. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create a user guide on how to input questions and generate reports.
   - [ ] Document the codebase for developers, including installation and running instructions.

#### 12. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy the MVP to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) if needed.
   - [ ] Ensure the app is scalable if deployed online (handle concurrent user requests).
